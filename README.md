# Bangalore-Traffic-Prediction-App-Pure-Sciket-Learn-No-AutoML-
This project predicts Bangaloreâ€™s traffic volume using machine learning through various ml pipelines. It preprocesses data, applies models, and provides real-time predictions via an interactive Streamlit app, making it ideal for traffic management and analysis.

# Project Summary (Pls note best code is 14_iteration.py)

This project predicts traffic volume in Bangalore by analyzing traffic and environmental data. It preprocesses the data, applies machine learning models, and provides predictions through an interactive Streamlit app. The system is designed for scalability, offering users the ability to upload datasets and visualize predictions in real-time.

# Key Features:

Predicts traffic volume based on historical data and environmental factors.

Includes preprocessing steps like date decomposition and handling missing values.

Interactive Streamlit app for uploading datasets and generating predictions.

Provides visualizations like heatmaps and performance metrics for better insights.

Saves models and preprocessing pipelines for future use.

# Modules Used:

Scikit-learn: For preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Streamlit: For creating an interactive user interface.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualizations and heatmaps.

Pickle: For saving models and encoders for reuse.
